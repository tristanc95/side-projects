So this is something I've been wanting to do for a while now.

I use youtube-dl (specifically yt-dlp) constantly to download channels, playlists, and videos for archive reasons as well as to put things on my phone. 
Of course, using yt-dlp via the command line can be a bit rough at times since you have to still type in all the outputs manually. I did have a hotkey set on my mouse, but sometimes I would accidentally hit it, which causes my
computer to start acting up while it inputs the commands.

I know I could've used the GUI, but I wanted to use this as an excuse to learn some new coding languages, and thus the YT-DL Project was born.

In this folder, it is going to be me creating a program in different languages that does the same thing:
Asks for the video link 
Asks if its a channel, playlist, or video
Opens up a ConEmu window and types in all the inputs for me
Offers to see if you have another video to download and repeat process.

It's a good way to get myself to learn new languages with something that works for me practically!

Please note these things though if you somehow show up upon this folder:

1. These languages / programs are set up to work specifically with MY own yt-dlp setup. If you stumble on this and want to use it yourself, you'll likely have to adjust parameters based on your own specific setup.
I'm sorry about them not being universal, but I don't unfortunately have the know-how well enough to do so, and I do mostly just make these for myself. I hope you understand.

2. I know my language and code is likely going to be messy and very amateurish. If you do have any recommendations, please feel free to mention it to me! I like to learn from what I made, so any tips are appreciated.

Also, here's my rankings of making these programs from easiest to hardest:

1. Python -- Technically the only one as of now (8.19.2022), but I'm sure this will move down. I found Python to be extremely frustrating in getting this program to work properly and even just finding ways to open up Windows programs correctly.
It became much of a stressor that I had to take a break on it. I'm happy it's done honestly.

2. Java -- Wow oh wow have I learned I do not like Java. I thought Python was frustrating but man I don't know if it's just because I went into this without taking any Java courses or anything, but Java is so confusing and I still don't fully get what I did on here, but I ended up making it work. It's way less complex than Python's because to be honest, I got it to work and I don't really want to do more of it.

Languages Planned:
Powershell
C#
Go (?)
Ruby (?)
